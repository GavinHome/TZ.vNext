Preparing an application to be profiled
==================================
Add a reference to HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.dll assembly (located in the Appender folder of the downloadable zip).
In the application startup (Application_Start in web applications, Program.Main in windows / console applications or the App constructor for WPF applications), make the following call:
HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.EntityFramework.EntityFrameworkProfiler.Initialize();

For running the profiler in production, use the HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.EntityFramework.EntityFrameworkProfiler.InitializeForProduction() method instead.


Profiling the application
=====================
Open the EFProf.exe
Start using the application you wish to profile
You should see the results immediately in the UI.
